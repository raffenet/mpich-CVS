x. SUBDIRS
The variables SUBDIRS instructs simplemake which subdirectories to
process.  Normally, this is a list of directories, but in some cases,
some of the directory names may be created by configure.  That is,
they are of the form @name@.  Simplemake can handle these variables if
the simplemake input file contains 

SUBDIRS_name = names of directories
for each @name@ that appears in a SUBDIRS list.  For example,

SUBDIRS_device_name = mm tcp shmem
SUBDIRS = util @device_name@ .
