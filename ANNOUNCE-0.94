			  MPICH-2 Version 0.94

The MPICH group at Argonne National Laboratory is pleased to announce
the availability of MPICH-2, version 0.94.  MPICH-2 is complete rewrite
of the MPICH portable implementation of MPI, the Message-Passing
Interface Standard.

MPICH-2 offers higher performance and greater robustness than the
original MPICH.  It will eventually provide an implementation of the
entire MPI-2 Standard.  Currently it contains all of MPI-1, the I/O part
of MPI-2 (sometimes called MPI-I/O), and a preliminary implementation of
the MPI active-target remote-memory operations (MPI_Put/MPI_Get).  Dynamic
process management functions will be coming in the next release.

At this point not as many communication devices have been implemented as
in MPICH-1, but communication over TCP sockets, or through shared
memory, or with a combination of the two, is currently supported.  The
default configuration is for all communication to take place over
sockets.

You can download MPICH-2 from http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich2.  It is
still considered a beta release since, although we have tested it
thoroughly in our own environment, it has not yet been tested by a wide
range of users.  We hope that this announcement will lead to more users.

Be sure and read the README in the top-level directory, since the way in
which MPICH jobs are started has changed substantially.  All the options
supported by the MPI-2 standard mpiexec are supported, together with a
few extensions, such as passing environment variables to individual MPI
processes.  Applications will have to be recompiled (since mpi.h is
new) and relinked.

If you experience problems, please report them to
mpich2-maint@mcs.anl.gov.  This will reach all of the developers.

The Windows version of MPICH2, for Windows 2000 and XP, can be obtained
from  ____________________.
