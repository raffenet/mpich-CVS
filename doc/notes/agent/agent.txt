- what are the requirements for the communication agent?

  - driven by the needs of RMA, Pt2Pt, and Collective 


- Agent is responsible for transportation and "matching"

  In the send/recv case, matching is as simple as matching the standard MPI
  envelope information.

  In the RMA case, "matching" is much more complicated.  RMA operation
  messages/RHCs need to be matched to exposure epochs.  Before an operation
  message can be processed, locks, etc. may need to be acquired.

- what we're doing here is allowing the origin to create a string of CARs
  that the target will service, serialize these CARS, pass them to the
  target, and place them in the appropriate queue for service - but not
  quite, because there is some translation/processing that has to be done
  here.

  - they cause matching and/or creation of CARs on the other side that
    correspond to completion of operations desired by the origin

  - in a put case, can you just serialize a recv of the data?  no, you can't
    do this.  there has to be something else going on.  so CARs can be
    created as a result of the reception of a CAM.  damn.

  - one way to look at this is that CAR processing could create additional
    CARs to be processed...this would cleanly handle the put case - origin
    serializes the put, and the target creates the corresponding recv after
    processing the put CAR?

  - a series of RMA operations could be described as a chain of operation
    CARs where each operation has a data CARs hung off of it
