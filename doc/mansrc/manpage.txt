    MPI - Introduction to the Message-Passing Interface

Description:

MPI stands for Message Passing Interface. , simply

MPI is a specification (like C or Fortran) and there are a number of 
implementations.  The rest of this man page describes the use of the MPICH
implementation of MPI.

Getting started:

Add MPI to your path
.vb
	% set path = ( $path /usr/local/mpi/bin )
.ve
Compute pi to a given resolution on 8 processors or threads
.vb
	% mpiexec -n 8 /usr/local/mpi/examples/cpi
.ve

You can compile and link your own MPI programs with the commands 'mpicc',
'mpif77', and 'mpicxx':
.vb
        % mpicc -o cpi cpi.c
        % mpif77 -o fpi fpi.f
	% mpicxx -o cxxpi cxxpi.cxx
.ve

Documentation:

Postscript documentation can be found in directory
/usr/local/mpi/doc/.  These include an introductory guide
(guide.ps) and a user manual (manual.ps).

Man pages exist for every MPI subroutine and function.  The man pages are
also available on the Web at 'http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/www'.
Additional on-line information is available at 'http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi',
including a hypertext version of the standard, information on other libraries
that use MPI, and pointers to other MPI resources.
