MPICH is a freely available, portable implementation of MPI, the Standard for
message-passing libraries. 

%% Heading: C++ and \texttt{SEEK\_SET}
%% Filename: cxxseek

Some users may get error messages such as
\begin{verbatim}
    SEEK_SET is #defined but must not be for the C++ binding of MPI
\end{verbatim}
The problem is that both \texttt{stdio.h} and the MPI C++ interface use
\texttt{SEEK\_SET}, \texttt{SEEK\_CUR}, and \texttt{SEEK\_END}.  This is really a
bug in the MPI-2 standard.  You can try adding 
\begin{verbatim}
    #undef SEEK_SET
    #undef SEEK_END
    #undef SEEK_CUR
\end{verbatim}
before \texttt{mpi.h} is included, or add the definition
\begin{verbatim}
    -DMPICH_IGNORE_CXX_SEEK
\end{verbatim}
to the command line (this will cause the MPI versions of \texttt{SEEK\_SET}
etc. to be skipped).
