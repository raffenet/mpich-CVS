                 technique in PVM significantly improves the
                 message-passing performance in heterogeneous
                 environments. The improvements are due to two factors:
                 (1). RMR reduces the need for conversions in a
                 heterogeneous environment; (2). At most each message is
                 converted, only once compared to twice for XDR used in
                 public version of PVM, and our conversion routines are
                 streamlined and are several times faster than the XDR
                 routines. The drawback to RMR is the potential need for
                 a large number of conversion routines. We demonstrate
                 that only a small number of routines are required
                 because many vendors use the IEEE standard for data
                 representation. Given this fact, RMR may emerge as a
                 promising technique in distributed computing.",
