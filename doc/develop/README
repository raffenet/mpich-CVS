This directory is intended to contain information for developers
Currently empty because the group has not agreed on any method for
maintaining this information.  It is better for now that outside 
developers read the code.

There are some files in the CVS attic that may be restored if there is 
any interest in following a documented development process.  Those files are
develop.tex - overview
collop.tex - access to collective operations
namepub.tex - name publisher interface
