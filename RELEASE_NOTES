                              Known Deficiencies
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- MPI_IRECV operations that are not explicitly completed before MPI_FINALIZE is
  called may fail to complete before MPI_FINALIZE returns, and thus never
  complete.  Furthermore, any matching send operations may erroneously fail.
  By explicitly completed, we mean that the request associated with the
  operation is completed by one of the MPI_TEST or MPI_WAIT routines.

- MPI_INTERCOMM_CREATE does not work correctly when the union of the local and
  remote communicators are not already part of an existing (intra or inter)
  communicator.  For example, if communicator A spawns a set of processes whose
  MPI_COMM_WORLD we will refer to as communicator B.  Likewise, communicator B
  spawns a set of processes whose MPI_COMM_WORLD we will refer to as
  communicator C.  Despite being a legal request, MPI_INTERCOMM_CREATE will
  fail to create a new intercommunicator between A and C using a commom process
  in B.
