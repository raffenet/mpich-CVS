MPI Profiling interface
   If weak symbols are not present, you must use

     -lmpich -lpmpich -lmpich

   to link programs.  This is due to the fact that some of the helper functions
   for the MPI calls are defined only for the pmpi versions (as they should
   be) but some of the ADI routines are only in the mpich library.  


It would be nice if the top-level configure echoed its arguments as the
first line of output like some of the subdirectory configures do.
