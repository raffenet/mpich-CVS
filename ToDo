MPI Profiling interface
   If weak symbols are not present, you must use

     -lmpich -lpmpich -lmpich

   to link programs.  This is due to the fact that some of the helper functions
   for the MPI calls are defined only for the pmpi versions (as they should
   be) but some of the ADI routines are only in the mpich library.  

   The LIBS variable is correctly set by the top level configure to include
   the necessary libraries.

It would be nice if the top-level configure echoed its arguments as the
first line of output like some of the subdirectory configures do.

Finalize steps:
   Invoke the attribute delete functions on MPI_COMM_WORLD and
   MPI_COMM_SELF (see MPI-2 standard).  Perhaps use a function within 
   a finalize callback registered as part of the keyval finalize handler
   or the comm world/self handler.

   If a group is created by MPI_Comm_group on a predefined communicator,
   we need to free the group during MPI_Finalize.  

make distclean should remove the files in <BUILDDIR>/bin.  This is not
completely straight forward since the PM files are installed into the build
tree by src/pm/Makefile using "cd <PM> ; make prefix=<BUILDDIR> install".
