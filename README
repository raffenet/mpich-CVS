		 MPICH2 Development Snapshot Release

This tarball contains a development snapshot of MPICH2.  This is not
an official release.  It has not been extensively tested.  Depending
on your system, it may not even compile.  If you are interested in
what the next generation of MPICH will look like, this tarball is for
you.  If you are looking for an implementation of MPI for use in
building and running your favorite application(s), please obtain the
MPICH 1.2.X distribution from http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich.

To build MPICH2 with the TCP channel, do the following:

    tar xzf mpich2-devsnapshot.tar.gz
    cd mpich2-<SNAPSHOT_DATE>
    ./configure
    make

You should now have a complete build of MPICH2.  If you wish to
install MPICH2, you should build MPICH2 as follows.

    ./configure --prefix=<INSTALL_DIR>
    make
    make install

Example and test programs (both source and executables) can be found
in ./examples and ./test/mpi/basic, respectively.  To run any of these
programs, you will need to start MPD.

   echo "password=<YOUR_MPD_PASSWORD_HERE>" >~/.mpd.conf
   chmod 600 ~/.mpd.conf
   ./bin/mpd &

Should you wish to setup a MPD ring across multiple machines, more
advanced instructions for MPD can be found in ./src/pm/mpd/README.

Once you have MPD running, you may run the hello world program as
follows.

    cd examples
    ../bin/mpiexec -np 2 hellow
