		 MPICH2 Development Snapshot Release

This tarball contains a development snapshot of MPICH2.  This is not
an official release.  It has not been extensively tested.  Depending
on your system, it may not even compile.  If you are interested in
what the next generation of MPICH will look like, this tarball is for
you.  If you are looking for a MPI implementation to build and run
your favorite application, please obtain a copy of MPICH 1.2.X from
http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich.

To build MPICH2 with the TCP channel, do the following:

    tar xzf mpich2-devsnapshot.tar.gz
    cd mpich2-<SNAPSHOT-DATE>
    ./configure
    make
    cd src/pmi/impls/mpd
    ./configure --prefix=/<ABSOLULTE_PATH_TO>/mpich2-<SNAPSHOT-DATE>
    make
    make install
    cd ../../../..

You now have a complete installation.  Example and test programs (both
source and executables) can be found in ./examples and
./test/mpi/basic, respectively.  To run any of these programs, you
will needed to start MPD.

   echo "password=<YOUR_MPD_PASSWORD_HERE>" >~/.mpd.conf
   chmod 600 ~/.mpd.conf
   ./bin/mpd &

Should you wish to set up a MPD ring across multiple machines, more
advanced instructions for MPD can be found in
./src/pmi/impls/mpd/README.

Then, to run the hello world program, execute the following:

    cd examples
    ../bin/mpdrun -np 2 hellow
