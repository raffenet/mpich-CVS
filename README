		 MPICH2 Development Snapshot Release

This tarball contains a development snapshot of MPICH2.  This is not
an official release.  It has not been extensively tested.  Depending
on your system, it may not even compile.  If you are interested in
what the next generation of MPICH will look like, this tarball is for
you.  If you are looking for an implementation of MPI for use in
building and running your favorite application(s), please obtain the
MPICH 1.2.X distribution from http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich.

To build MPICH2 with the TCP channel, do the following:

    tar xzf mpich2-devsnapshot.tar.gz
    cd mpich2-<SNAPSHOT_DATE>
    ./configure
    make

(If your tar does not support the z option, use
   gunzip -c mpich2-devsnapshot.tar.gz | tar xf -
for the first line)
(VPATH builds are supported as well; see below).

You should now have a complete build of MPICH2.  If you wish to
install MPICH2, you should build MPICH2 as follows.

    ./configure --prefix=<INSTALL_DIR>
    make
    make install

Example and test programs (both source and executables) can be found
in ./examples and ./test/mpi/basic, respectively.  To run any of these
programs, you will need to start MPD.

   touch ~/.mpd.conf
   chmod 600 ~/.mpd.conf
   echo "password=<YOUR_MPD_PASSWORD_HERE>" >>~/.mpd.conf
   ./bin/mpd &

The password should *not* be the same as any other password that you use;
this password is used exclusively within the MPD system.

Should you wish to setup a MPD ring across multiple machines, more
advanced instructions for MPD can be found in ./src/pm/mpd/README.

Once you have MPD running, you may run the hello world program as
follows.

    cd examples
    ../bin/mpiexec -np 2 hellow

To shut MPD down, run

    ./bin/mpdallexit

What compiles but doesn't work
------------------------------
We don't guarantee that *anything* works yet.  However, we have run parts of 
the MPICH-1 test suite and some of the tests included with this release.
Among the routines that compile but that are known not to work yet are:

MPI_Cancel for sends, persistent requests
MPI_Get_elements

Routines not yet available include

MPI_Bsend_init
MPI_Sendrecv_replace

Testing Status
--------------
We are beginning to run regular tests of the MPI-1 functions.  We are 
using both the MPICH-1 test suite and the Intel test suite (with corrections).
The current status is available at 
http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich/micronotes/mpich2-tests .

VPATH Builds
------------
MPICH2 supports building MPICH in a different directory tree than the one
where the MPICH2 source is installed.  This often allows faster building, as
the sources can be placed in a shared filesystem and the builds done in a
local (and hence usually much faster) filesystem.  To make this clear,
the following example assumes that the sources are placed in 
/usr/me/mpich2-10-25-02, the build is done in /tmp/me/mpich2, and the 
installed version goes into /usr/local/mpich2-test:

    cd /usr/me
    tar xzf mpich2-devsnapshot.tar.gz
    cd /tmp/me
    # Assume /tmp/me already exists
    mkdir mpich2
    cd mpich2
    /usr/me/mpich2-10-25-02/configure --prefix=/usr/local/mpich2-test
    make
    make install
