This directory contains common support routines that may be used to 
implement mpiexec .  They include

cmnargs.c - Command line processing for mpiexec .  Handles all arguments, 
  including the ... : ... notation .  Creates a "process table" that 
  describes the programs to run.  There is one entry per specified program,
  even if the program will be run on multiple processes.  (This is 
  necessary in handling the "soft" option.)

  interface .  

rm.c - A simple "resource manager", this accepts a list of available 
  machines and a process table structure and returns an expanded process table 
  with one entry per machine.
