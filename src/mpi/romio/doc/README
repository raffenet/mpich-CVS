This directory contains some documents relevant to ROMIO.

adio.ps.gz: Describes the internal abstract-device interface, which is the
            key component of ROMIO.

dtype.ps.gz: Explains how I/O performance improves when users use derived 
             datatypes and file views to describe noncontiguous accesses.

ext2ph.ps.gz: For collective I/O, ROMIO uses a generalized version of 
              the algorithm described in this paper.
