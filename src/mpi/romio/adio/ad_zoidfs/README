ad_zoidfs
=========

ad_zoidfs is an ADIO module for zoidfs. It is not a complete implementation. 
It has not been debugged at all, either. However, it should give some ideas
about what the actual implementation looks like. ad_zoidfs is based on 
ad_pvfs2. 

ADIOI_ZOIDFS_WriteStrided has not been implemented yet, but should look like 
its counterpart, ADIOI_ZOIDFS_ReadStrided.
