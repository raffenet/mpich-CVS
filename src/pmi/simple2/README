This directory contains an experimental, version 2 PMI interface.  Both
the client API and the wire protocol for this version are different than
PMI version 1.  This version is not yet in use in MPICH2, and is 
being developed to prototype the changes proposed.  In particular, this version
adds support for better thread-safe behavior.

A major issue that PMI verison 2 needs to address is thread-safety and
responsiveness.  In particular, no thread that is waiting on a PMI call can 
block other threads, even PMI_Spawn.
