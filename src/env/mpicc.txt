    mpicc - Compiles and links MPI programs written in C

    Description:
    This command can be used to compile and link MPI programs written in
    C.  It provides the options and any special libraries that are
    needed to compile and link MPI programs.  

    It is important to use this command, particularly when linking programs, 
    as it provides the necessary libraries.  

    Command line arguments:
+  -show      - Show the commands that would be used without
             runnning them
.  -help      - Give short help
.  -echo      - Show exactly what this program is doing.
             This option should normally not be used.
-  others     - are passed to the compiler or linker.  For example, '-c'
    causes files to be compiled, '-g' selects compilation with debugging
    on most systems, and '-o name' causes linking with the output
    executable given the name 'name'.

    Environment Variables:
    The environment variables 'MPICH_CC' and 'MPICH_CLINKER' may be used
    to select different C compiler and linker.  Note that since
    MPICH is built with a particular C and Fortran compiler, change the
    compilers used can cause problems.  Use this only if you could intermix
    code compiled with the different compilers.

    Examples:
To compile a single file 'foo.c', use
.vb
   mpicc -c foo.c 
.ve

To link the output and make an executable, use
.vb
   mpicc -o foo foo.o
.ve
Combining compilation and linking in a single command
.vb
   mpicc -o foo foo.c
.ve
is a convenient way to build simple programs.
