TODO:

- Generate function renaming

- Include definitions from device into mpi.h, allowing function renaming, etc.

- Add a mpiexec script that conforms to the MPI-2 and the expected MPICH2 extensions

- update the outdated mpid compiler scripts to be more like those in src/env

- Singleton init


Open questions:

Things needed from Globus:

- Support for long double and fixed sized integers (ex: uint32_t) in the Globus data conversion module


Things needed from MPICH2:

- Allow long long and long double support to be explicitly disabled even if the compiler support those types.  The vendor MPI
  may not support MPI_LONG_LONG or MPI_LONG_LONG_INT, and the Globus data conversion library doesn't support long double.
