Goals

* Define semantics of all routines so that others can write to the interface

* Primary design is for MPICH2, but should also be useable by SMPD, etc.

* Allow implementation of passive target OSC (asynchronous progress engine)

* Allow fault tolerant implementation of dynamic process interface

--------------------

Requirements

* sock_post_close() must be able to interrupt a posted read and/or write.  What
  about a connect?  What about a listener with accepted socks in the queue?

* Error codes must be both descriptive of the problem and allow programatic
  decisions to be made.

* It would be useful if post_read/write() could handle a byte range (min/max)

* Restrict connections and listeners to a range of ports (req #125)

* Must be reasonably thread-safe and thread supportive.  For example, it must
  be possible to wake up sock_wait().  It should also be possible to post a new
  read or write while a thread is blocked in sock_wait().

* Do we need anything special for proxy communication?  Do we even want to
  support it?

--------------------

Issues

* sock_get_last_os_error()?  portability?  thread safety?

* if we use MPI error codes, we will need to link part of MPICH2 into SMPD.
  this could cause initialization problems.

* MPI error codes are not descriptive enough to allow programatic response to
  errors.  we could extend the MPI error classes to better define internal
  errors.  the top-level routine (or maybe ADI3 routine) would be responsible
  for returning a proper error class.
