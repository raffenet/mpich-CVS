The MPE-2 has a top level configure.in and all the C source files are
splitted into 4 subpackages, each has its own include and source directory
and configure.  Because of this structure, the install and build include
directory contains only relevant user .h files, i.e. mpe.h,
mpe_log.h, mpe_logf.h, mpe_graphics.h, mpe_graphicsf.h and mpe_misc.h.
(no more basex11.h, basex11.h...).  Some of the include files could be 
empty if the corresponding subpackage is not built.

- The top level configure checks for F77 characteristics and stores them
  in mpe2/mpe_conf.h and checks for the usability of MPI_CC and MPI_F77.
  The 4 subpackages are src/misc, src/logging, src/wrappers and src/graphics.
  Each subpackage checks for the features that it needs.

  1) src/misc: contains dbxerr.c.in and definition of MPE_Errors_xx,
               MPE_Seq_xxx(), MPE_xxxTags() and MPE_GetHostName().

  2) src/logging: contains CLOG-2 and MPE_Log_xxx() routines.
 
  3) src/wrappers: contains various MPI wrapper libraries,
                   MPI logging library, liblmpe.a,
                   MPI tracing library, libtmpe.a,
                   MPI Fortran to C library, libmpe_f2cmpi.a.

  4) src/graphics: contains MPE X graphics routines and MPI animation
                   library, libampe.a.  This subpackage is all X related.

  only package src/wrappers requires package src/logging, the others
  are pretty much independent from one another.
