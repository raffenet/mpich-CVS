1, investigate if base.drawable.Coord class's lineID needs to be Integer
   instead of int.  A performance issue with lineID to rowID mapping used
   in base.drawable.{Primitive,Shadow}'s drawState().

2, separate the code that reads slog2's treenode from the main event
   dispatching thread, i.e. increase overlap.

3, coordinate the color change in Legend window to that of Timeline window

4, reorder of the category label in the Legend window

5, Timeline window's layout problem, i.e. between the timeline panel
   and ruler panel.
