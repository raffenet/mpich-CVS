Frequent Asked Question and Anwser:

1, Why rectangles, states, are NOT properly nested sometimes ?  It seems
   They are nested correctly in some frames but not always.  Also, the 
   incorrect nesting is sometimes fixed by doing zoom in/out.   In some
   occasions, the incorrect nesting is displayed across an invisible
   vertical line during scrolling.

   All these symptoms can be explained if the states are NOT arranged
   strictly in endtime order in the slog2 file.  Contact your TRACE-API
   implementator for further support on this issue. ( TRACE-API is the
   interface used to create the SLOG-2 file ).  To make sure that
   all drawables inside the slog2 file is arranged in correct endtime
   order is to run traceTOslog2( or its variant like rlogTOslog2..)
   on the original trace with option -tc which turns on the time order
   checking code.

2, Why the color of some states in Timeline window is different from
   those in Legend window ?

   SLOG-2 allows transparency in defining color of any drawables.
   If the TRACE-API implementation that you use to generate SLOG-2 file
   uses transparency (instead of using opaque), the effect is that when
   there are several states nested together, the color of the state  
   on top of other states may have altered because of mixing of
   alpha channel of state's color with that of others.  This effect
   can be easily seen when the background is black, i.e. all states 
   may appear to be darker.
   
3, How can launch Jumpshot-4 in native Windows enviroment ?

   First install Java2 runtime enviroment on Windows, i.e. jre 1.2.2 to 1.4.2
   or up, then launch Jumpshot-4 in native Windows environment by clicking
   on the lib/jumpshot_launcher.jar.  The Java Virtual Machine's launch 
   parameters can be modified in $HOME/.jumpshot_launcher.conf.
