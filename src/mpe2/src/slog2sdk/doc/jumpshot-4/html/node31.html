4.1 Search and Scan Facility</A>
</H1>

<P>
The Level-of-detail support provided in SLOG-2 and Jumpshot-4 tends
to help locate states which are either longer in time or occur very
frequently. States that are short and occur rarely in a big logfile
are very difficult to locate without any special tool. In Jumpshot-4,
a search and scan facility is provided to facilitate this goal. There
are 3 search criteria: search time, searchable timeline IDs and searchable
categories. 

<P>

<OL>
<LI><I>Search Time</I> is the time that search starts. It is marked by
a yellow line called search cursor. There are 2 different ways of
setting the search cursor. When the timeline canvas is in Hand mode
as described in Figure <A HREF="node13.html#fig:mouse_hand_mode">3.11</A> of section <A HREF="node13.html#sub:Zoomable-and-Scrollable">3.4.1</A>,
left mouse clicking will set the search cursor. The other way can
be done in either Hand or Zoom mode. First popup an information dialog
box of any kind using right mouse clicking, then press the SearchInitialize
button in the toolbar to replace the green line by the yellow search
cursor. When there are more than one information dialog box, the information
dialog box that is shown up last will have its green line used to
initialize the search cursor. When Timeline window first starts up,
the search cursor is set at the starttime of the logfile.
</LI>
<LI><I>Searchable Timeline IDs</I> are the timelines that search will
operate on, i.e only states on the marked timelines will be returned
by the search facility. These marked timelines can be selected by
clicking on their timeline IDs on Y-axis label panel with rules described
in Table <A HREF="#table:selection_rules">3.10</A>. When nothing is selected, all
timelines are searchable.
</LI>
<LI><I>Searchable Categories</I> are categories that have their searchable
checkboxes enabled as in Figure <A HREF="node11.html#fig:legend_checkbox_ops">3.8</A>. Only
drawable with searchable category can be returned by the search facility.
By default, all categories in Legend window are searchable. 
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
After setting any needed search criteria, the search operation can
be carried out by pressing either the SearchForeward or SearchBackward
buttons shown in Table <A HREF="#table:timeline_toolbar">3.12</A>. As shown in
Figure <A HREF="#fig:timeline_search_preview">4.1</A>, the search facility returns
a searched state which is marked by a transparent <A NAME="tex2html69"
  HREF="#foot602"><SUP>4.1</SUP></A>box with a 3D raised border and whose starttime is marked by a yellow
search cursor, an upper and a lower 3D arrowheads. The upper 3D arrow's
color matches that of the returned state. In the figure, since the
returned state is a preview state, so the upper 3D arrow is gray in
color as it is shown in Legend window. Accompanied with the 3D raised
bordered box is a popup Search Box that shows the detailed of the
preview state like the Drawable Info Box in Figure <A HREF="node19.html#fig:timeline_infobox_preview_state">3.16</A>.
Since the search in the figure is looking for state <I>eos</I>, a
Drawable Info Box is shown to indicate the returned 3D bordered box
does contain category <I>eos</I> graphically. In order to locate the
real state <I>eos</I>, a dragged zoom is performed around the 3D raised
bordered box and the result is shown in Figure <A HREF="#fig:timeline_search_preview_zoomed">4.2</A>.
In the figure, the real <I>eos</I> is located in the middle of the
original 3D bordered box and it is pointed by the Drawable Info Box.

<P>

<P>
In general, when searching on big slog2 file, all preview categories
should be set searchable, otherwise searching for real drawables may
not return anything. Because at lower zoom level, there may not be
any real drawables of the categories of interest, only preview drawable
contains the categories of interest. Also, the search facility is
carried out for the drawables that are in the physical memory. In
some rare occasions, drawables in the memory may have been exhausted
for searching before the end of the logfile has been reached, user
may need to advance the search by scroll forward or backward to read
in more drawables and to restart the search again. For a very big
logfile, the search process of a real state may require repeated operations
of search and dragged zoom before the real state can be found. This
process will be automated in the later version of Jumpshot-4.
