- Swing's DefaultBoundedRangeModel uses __int__ as type to represent
  min, max, value and extent.  This also affects model_time which is
  extended from DefaultBoundedRangeModel.  Approximately, if the
  tZoomFactor is 2.0 and zoomIn is called over ~ 22 times, there is
  risk of overflow in the represenatation of min, max in
  DefaultBoundedRangeModel.

  Solution, temporary!  Use DefaultLongBoundedRangeModel instead.
