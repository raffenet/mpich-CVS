This is SLOG-2 Standard Development Kit 

This version also contains a prototype Jumpshot, and sample implementation
of TRACE-API in trace_sample/

5/6/03 added Join method support in Jumpshot for AIX's UTE converted
       slog2 file, so disconnected bebit states can be connected in
       connected view as 1 state.

5/6/03 added an extra filter in traceTOslog2 and clogTOslog2 to remove
       unused categories

6/9/03 fixed some bugs related to the Join method.

6/9/03 modified slog2print so it is scalable.  It used to be slog2print
       read in the whole logfile recursively, this requires huge amount
       of memory.  The updated slog2print uses a new iterator to read in
       the logfile in a more scalable fashion.

6/9/03 added OverlapRatios PREVIEW_STATE_DISPLAY view and
       removed the DecreLegend view.  Added CumulativeExclusion tag
       but it is not implemented yet.

6/9/03 duplicate the control on PREVIEW_STATE_DISPLAY inside the Timeline
       window.  It is an active control.
