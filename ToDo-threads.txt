- convert usage of MPICH_THREAD_LEVEL to MPICH_MAX_THREAD_LEVEL as
  described in the documentation (BRT: I learned about the MAX version
  after having smattered the other throughout the code.)

- define a set of error codes for the MPE_Thread and MPID_Thread
  interfaces

- remove MPIR_ERRTEST_INITIALIZED_FIRSTORJUMP
