- Convert usage of MPICH_THREAD_LEVEL to MPICH_MAX_THREAD_LEVEL as
  described in the documentation (BRT: I learned about the MAX version
  after having smattered the other throughout the code.)

- Define a set of error codes for the MPE_Thread and MPID_Thread
  interfaces

- Remove MPIR_ERRTEST_INITIALIZED_FIRSTORJUMP

- Add tracking of the thread local storage in MPIR_Process so that the
  allocated storage can be properly freed either at thread destruction
  or MPI_Finalize, whichever comes first.  Right now, none of the
  thread local storage in MPIR_Process is freed.
  
- Fix the collective operation implementations so that nesting counter
  gets decremented even when an error occurs.
