Open Items:

* POSIX shared memory and message queues [David/Brian]

* number of parameters for MPID_Abort(), fix MPI_Abort() [Brian]

* sock and ssm connection formation code should not fail after the
  first attempt since the listener has a limited queue of pending
  connections [Brian/David]

* protocol specification for multi-method implementations for ssm
  [Rusty/David/Brian] (important for release???)

* documentation: installation and usage document(s) [Rusty]
  (see below)

* slog2sdk integration (configure) and testing [David/Brian]
  (the code is now being checked out into src/util/slog2sdk)

----

Finished Items:

* datatype test suite failures [Rob R.]

* majority of the tests passing for the shm and ssm channels
  [Brian/David]

* split CH3_Progress() into CH3_Progress_wait() and
  CH3_Progress_test() to avoid extra overhead associated with checking
  blocking flag and branching [David/Brian]

* improved distribution cutting script [Brian]

-----

Deferred Items:

* CH3 flow control [Brian]

* add MPIDI_CH3_Abort() [Brian]

* support for non-x86 architectures in the shm and ssm channels [David/Brian]

* SysV IPC resource recovery for all systems (not just Linux)
  [David/Brian]

* replace abort(), assert() and MPID_Abort() calls in sock channel
  with proper error handling (require reworking progress engine which
  has to be done anyway for MPI-2 support) [Brian]

* performance tuning of ssm and shm progress engines [David/Brian]

* more complete test suite for ROMIO [???]
