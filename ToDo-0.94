Discussion items:

- IPC resource registration/allocation and failure recovery

- SSM performance tuning: highest performance for N=P, or reasonable peformance
  for all N?

- other issues described below

- documentation: need detailed outline for user/installation document(s)

Datatypes

issue:		test suite failures
importance:	critical
assigned to:	Rob R.
description:	(to be expounded upon when Rob R. task switches back to MPICH2)

CH3 device

issue:		flow control
importance:	useful, but not critical for most applications
assigned to:	Brian
status:		not started
description:	add flow control for eager messages into the CH3 device


issue:		MPIDI_CH3_Abort()
importance:	useful, but not critical
assigned to:	Brian
status:		not started
description:	MPID_Abort() current just calls exit(), relying on the process
		manager to notice that a process exited without properly
		ending (calling PMI_Finalize() if PMI is used by the channel).
		MPID_Abort() should call MPIDI_CH3_Abort(), allowing the
		channel to properly terminate the job, and supply the process
		manager with the exit code.

issue:		MPID_Abort()
assigned to:	Brian
importance:	must fix to be MPI-1 compliant
status:		not started
description:	The current version of MPID_Abort() takes an MPI error code.
		It should take an exit code that is reported to the process
		manager.  Ideally it should call MPIDI_CH3_Abort(), but at the
		very least it should call exit() with the supplied exit code.
		The current MPID_Abort() prints error messages based on the
		MPI code.  This needs to be moved to the routines that call
		MPID_Abort(), of which there are many.

sock channel

issue:		connection formation
importance:	critical
assigned to:	Brian/David?
status:		not started
description:	Connection to a process may fail due to a backlog of accepted
		connections at the connectee.  The connector should perform
		so number of reties before reporting an error to the user.

issue:		MPID_Abort()
importance:	must be fixed to be MPI-1 compliant
assigned to:	Brian
status:		not started
description:	All calls to MPID_Abort() must be updated so that a useful
		error message is printed before MPI_Abort() is called with an
		exit code (not an MPI error code).

issue:		error handling
importance:	useful
assigned to:	Brian
status:		not started
description:	The calls to abort(), MPID_Abort() and many calls to assert()
		should be replaced with the generation of error codes which are
		then return to the CH3 device.  This may be somewhat difficult
		as it will require some code reorganization including that of
		the progress engine.
