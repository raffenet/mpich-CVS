CH3 device

issue:		flow control
importance:	useful, but not critical for most applications
assigned to:	Brian
description:	add flow control for eager messages into the CH3 device


issue:		MPIDI_CH3_Abort()
importance:	useful, but not critical
assigned to:	Brian
description:	MPID_Abort() current just calls exit(), relying on the process
		manager to notice that a process exited without properly
		ending (calling PMI_Finalize() if PMI is used by the channel).
		MPID_Abort() should call MPIDI_CH3_Abort(), allowing the
		channel to properly terminate the job, and supply the process
		manager with the exit code.

issue:		MPID_Abort()
assigned to:	Brian
importance:	must fix to be MPI-1 compliant
description:	The current version of MPID_Abort() takes an MPI error code.
		It should take an exit code that is reported to the process
		manager.  Ideally it should call MPIDI_CH3_Abort(), but at the
		very least it should call exit() with the supplied exit code.
		The current MPID_Abort() prints error messages based on the
		MPI code.  This needs to be moved to the routines that call
		MPID_Abort(), of which there are many.

sock channel

issue:		MPID_Abort()
importance:	must be fixed to be MPI-1 compliant
assigned to:	Brian
description:	All calls to MPID_Abort() must be updated so that a useful
		error message is printed before MPI_Abort() is called with an
		exit code (not an MPI error code).

issue:		error handling
importance:	useful
assigned to:	Brian
description:	The calls to abort(), MPID_Abort() and many calls to assert()
		should be replaced with the generation of error codes which are
		then return to the CH3 device.  This may be somewhat difficult
		as it will require some code reorganization including that of
		the progress engine.
