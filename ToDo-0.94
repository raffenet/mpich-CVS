Open Items:

* (ssm) topology/protocol specification [Rusty/David/Brian] (Thursday,
  08/07/2003, 13:00)

* number of parameters for MPID_Abort(), fix MPI_Abort() [Brian]
  (Thursday, 08/07/2003, 13:00)

* MPICH2 req buzz [all] (Friday, 08/08/2003, 10:30)

* (shm/ssm) investigate (and fix?) few remaining test failures
  [Brian/David]

* POSIX shared memory and message queues [David/Brian]

* (sock/ssm) connection formation code should not fail after the
  first attempt since the listener has a limited queue of pending
  connections [Brian/David]

* modify configure to ensure --with-pm and --with-pmi consistency
  [Brian]

* documentation: installation and usage document(s) [Rusty]
  (see below)

* slog2sdk integration (configure) and testing [David/Brian/Anthony]
  (the code is now being checked out into src/util/slog2sdk)

* configure option to specify level/depth of logging [Brian/David]

* check out ROMIO test failures [Rob R.]

* measure and compare performance of sock and ssm (using sock) [David]

* measure and compare performance of shm and ssm (using shm) [David]

----

Finished Items:

* datatype test suite failures [Rob R.]

* (shm/ssm) bug fixes so that a majority of the tests are passing
  [Brian/David]

* split CH3_Progress() into CH3_Progress_wait() and
  CH3_Progress_test() to avoid extra overhead associated with checking
  blocking flag and branching [David/Brian]

* improved distribution cutting script [Brian]

-----

Deferred Items:

* CH3 flow control [Brian]

* add MPIDI_CH3_Abort() [Brian]

* support for non-x86 architectures in the shm and ssm channels [David/Brian]

* SysV IPC resource recovery for all systems (not just Linux)
  [David/Brian]

* performance tuning of ssm and shm progress engines [David/Brian]

* more complete test suite for ROMIO [???]

* heterogeneous communication in the CH3 device [Brian/David?]

* work with Phil on writing directly to user space of other processes
  [David/Brian]

* have configure print out available channels, process managers,
  etc. for current machine [Brian]

* fix design and implementations of sock [Brian/David]

* deprecate sock channel in favor of ssm? this depends on performance
  and CPU load issues. [Brian/David]

* (ssm/sock) replace abort(), assert() and MPID_Abort() calls with
  proper error handling (require reworking progress engine which has
  to be done anyway for MPI-2 support) [Brian/David]

* (ssm/sock) if the business card of a remote process contains
  multiple socket listeners, try each until a connection is formed
  [Brian/David]
