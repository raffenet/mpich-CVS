Open Items:

* (ch3:shm/ssm) investigate (and fix?) few remaining test failures
  [David/Brian]

* (req #23) modify configure to ensure --with-pm and --with-pmi consistency
  [Brian] (could be deferred)

* documentation: installation and usage document(s) [Rusty]
  (see below)

* (req #91,84,76,71,70,62,61,53,52,48,47,39,46,33,27) MPD problems
  [Rusty/Ralph] (fixed?)

* (req #87) fix hello world hang on Alpha (Redhat 7.2, gcc 2.96) [Brian]

* (req #77) test that logging compiles (all states are defined) before
  releasing tarball [Bill/David/Brian] -- done - a new test script
  ensures that these are tested.  Note that the nightlies will do this
  as part of the random tests.

* measure and compare performance of sock and ssm (using sock) [David]

* measure and compare performance of shm and ssm (using shm) [David]

----

Finished Items:

* change number of parameters to MPID_Abort(), fix MPI_Abort() [Brian]

* (req #65) add configure checks for va_copy(), etc. and update dbg_printf.c
  [Brian] (Bill took while fixing opteron nightlies)

* (ch3:shm/ssm) POSIX shared memory [David/Brian]

* temporary fix for ROMIO test failures [Brian]

* configure option to specify level/depth of logging [Brian/David]

* datatype test suite failures [Rob R.]

* (ch3:shm/ssm) bug fixes so that a majority of the tests are passing
  [Brian/David]

* (ch3) split CH3_Progress() into CH3_Progress_wait() and
  CH3_Progress_test() to avoid extra overhead associated with checking
  blocking flag and branching [David/Brian]

* slog2sdk added to src/util/slog2sdk allowing logging with rlog
  [Anthony/David/Brian]

* (ch3:sock) active target OSC working for CH3 sock channel [Rajeev]

-----

Deferred Items:

* MPICH2 req buzz [all] (Friday, 08/22/2003, 13:00)

* (ch3:ssm) topology/protocol specification [Bill/Rusty/David/Brian]

* POSIX message queues (use new job id to allocate per job message queue in
  ssm) [David/Brian]

* add PMI_Get_id() to obtain unique job identifier [Brian/David/Rusty/Rajeev]

* move f77 wrappers into a separate library to support MPE logging of
  f77 codes [Bill/Brian]

* MPE full integration and testing (slog2sdk is now being checked out into
  src/util/slog2sdk to support rlog) [Bill/Anthony/David/Brian]
  -- partially done (Bill and Anthony); mpe directory under src/mpe (not 
  the final location) and top-level configure knows how to build mpe if
  mpe directory is present and mpe selected.

* (ch3) active target OSC for all channels (includes moving code from existing
  CAs to special OSC CAs) [Rajeev/Brian]

* (ch3) dynamic process (spawn/connect/accept) implementation (partially
  working for sock channel) [Rajeev/Brian]

* (util/sock) revisit the sock interface and redo sock implementations to
  support multi-threaded codes, and increase robustness and error reporting
  [Brian/David]

* (ch3:sock) rework sock channel to support disconnect of dynamic processes,
  and increase robustness and error reporting [Brian/David/Rajeev]

* (ch3) add new function to notify the channel when the VC reference count
  reaches zero.  this gives the channel an opportunity to release references to
  internal channel structures and cleanly shutdown of the any underlying
  connection(s) (this is needed for MPI_Comm_free() and MPI_Comm_disconnect())
  [Brian]

* (mpi) MPI_Comm_disconnect() must wait for all bsend communication associated
  with the comm to complete.  It should call MPID_Comm_disconnect() so that
  devices that buffer sends can complete those sends and release VC
  resources. [Brian?]

* (ch3) define CH3 interface to support the use of RDMA operations for OSC
  (first draft complete but needs work) [Bill/Rajeev/Brian]

* add MPI_Type_create_{darray,subarray} to MPICH2 and update ROMIO to properly
  handle these new types [Rob R.]

* (req #23) remove uni implementation of PMI [Bill/Brian]

* (req #24) check for valid timer types in configure [Brian]

* (req #93) select() implementation of sock for Mac OS X (possibly augment
  poll() implementation) [Brian/David]

* IA-64 support in shm and ssm channels [Brian/David]

* improved distribution cutting script [Brian/Rusty]

* (sock/ssm) connection formation code should not fail after the
  first attempt since the listener has a limited queue of pending
  connections [Brian/David]

* (ch3) flow control [Brian]

* (ch3) for rendezvous protocol, only amount of data that will fit in the
  receive buffer (there is no need to send all of the data because truncation
  can be detected on the receive side) [Brian]

* add MPIDI_CH3_Abort() [Brian]

* support for non-x86 architectures in the shm and ssm channels [David/Brian]

* (req #63) SysV IPC resource recovery for all systems (not just Linux)
  [David/Brian]

* performance tuning of ssm and shm progress engines [David/Brian]

* more complete test suite for ROMIO [???]

* heterogeneous communication in the CH3 device [Brian/David?]

* work with Phil on writing directly to user space of other processes
  [David/Brian]

* have configure print out available channels, process managers,
  etc. for current machine [Brian]

* fix design and implementations of sock [Brian/David]

* deprecate sock channel in favor of ssm? this depends on performance
  and CPU load issues. [Brian/David]

* (ssm/sock) replace abort(), assert() and MPID_Abort() calls with
  proper error handling (require reworking progress engine which has
  to be done anyway for MPI-2 support) [Brian/David]

* (ssm/sock) if the business card of a remote process contains
  multiple socket listeners, try each until a connection is formed
  [Brian/David]

* (req #35) buffer alignment issues with Red Hat libraries on Alpha ev5
  processors

* (req #16) DNS scalability - reduce number of name (and reverse name) lookups
  in sock and ssm channels [Brian/David]
