* (shm/ssm) bug fixes so that a majority of the tests are passing
  [Brian/David]

Deferred Items:

* (req #23) remove uni implementation of PMI [Bill/Brian]

* (req #24) check for valid timer types in configure [Brian]

* (req #93) select() implementation of sock for Mac OS X (possibly augment
  poll() implementation) [Brian/David]
